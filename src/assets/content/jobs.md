# Mission

MyCrypto is one of the world's leading interfaces for the Ethereum blockchain. **We strive to provide the most secure, usable, and non-custodial experiences for crypto-asset management.**

We strongly believe that decentralization through blockchains can enable a fairer interaction between people. But not everyone has the time or resources to navigate all the quirks of the crypto space and DeFi. MyCrypto solves this by focusing on user experience and gives everyone the ability to manage their digital assets in a non-custodial manner. At the same time, we are acutely aware that this is only possible if the tools we use are secure enough to protect the individual from theft and privacy invasion.

Each decision we make seeks to strike the proper balance between these elements to make the promise of Web3 a reality today.

### Products

Our core product is available at [mycrypto.com/](https://mycrypto.com/). We also maintain [legacy](https://download.mycrypto.com/) versions for older operating systems and run several community-focused tools, such as [CryptoScamDB](https://cryptoscamdb.org/) and [FindETH](https://findeth.io/).

### Life at MyCrypto

We're a distributed (remote) team ðŸš€ with core operations based in Los Angeles. We have team members in more than five countries, across three continents.

Our team is composed of unique and talented individuals, with different backgrounds and experiences. We are proud of this diversity and believe everyone can add value to all aspects of our company. We encourage everyone to grow both personally and professionally.
