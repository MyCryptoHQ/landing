# Join Our Team

MyCrypto is one of the worldâ€™s leading interfaces for the Ethereum blockchain, offering a suite of products for all types of people. We strive to build things that _actually_ solve real problems, and we iterate quickly. We take an holistic approach to improving this ecosystem and people's lives, prioritizing security, customer support, and being part of this amazing community along with building amazing products.

In order to accomplish this, we must have a team compromised of unique, talented individuals. We value different backgrounds and experiences and believe everyone can add value to all aspects of our company. We encourage everyone to grow both personally and professionally.

Lastly, while we like to move fast, we have processes to make everyone's life easier and use tools to make remote life better. This is a start-up and a remote environment, but you aren't living in a lonely bubble. We use Slack for communication, Tandem for hanging out, Clubhouse for project management, Front for support, Confluence for internal documentation, and Github for code and public documentation.

##### Things You Probably Care About

- Weâ€™re a decentralized (remote) team ðŸš€ with core operations based in Los Angeles.
- We have team members in more than 5 countries, across three continents.
- We move fast and encourage autonomy. This means you are responsible for managing your time and priorities.
- All positions begin as a contract role, part-time or full-time.
- Most positions will move to full-time employment (if you are able to be employed in the US)
- Unique perks are available for those who are part of our team full-time, regardless of contractor or employee status. Sometimes we'll send you to events around the world, we'll help you [bank your stem cells](https://foreverlabs.com/), and may offer equity (even for those located outside the US.)

##### Things We Care About

- Security is the number one priority. You must work with that mentality and strive to be secure in your personal and professional life.
- You are detail-oriented and can work independently.
- You use our products, understand their value, and want to make them better.
- You have experience and **enjoy** the flexibility that comes with working in an async & remote environment.
- You are excited and passionate about crypto and want to help build the decentralized future.

##### Things We Donâ€™t Care About

- When you sleep or work, where you are located, what you do in your free time, your gender, age, race, sexual preference, or websites you only open in incognito mode.

##### React / Javascript / Typescript Engineers

Specifically, we are currently looking for amazing React / Javascript / Typescript engineers to work on MyCrypto.com. We have a [new update](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/tree/gau) that is pretty huge and includes multi-account support and endless opportunities for unique features. We hope that you have worked in this space before and/or are passionate about the blockchain. Our products rarely have a traditional back-end, but that doesn't mean this is a strictly a "front-end" or "styling" job. It requires deep, client-side logic, an understanding of how to interact with the blockchain on a technical level, and the ability to figure shit out without great documentation because, well, this is crypto and apparently documentation comes second to changing the world. ðŸ˜‰

##### Everyone

We invite anyone who is interested in working with us to email us at [jobs@mycrypto.com](mailto:jobs@mycrypto.com) and pitch yourself and your unique skills and experiences. As a small team working in a fast-paced environment, we are always looking to add people to our team who want to build the decentralized future, are willing to wear multiple hats, and have a desire to grow our products and offerings.
